    <h3>Early life/History:</h3>
    <p>Larry page was born on March 26, 1973 in Lansing, Michigan. Both of his parents were computer science professors. At the age of 6, Larry started to get attracted by computers, and was interested in them. In his elementary school, he was the first one to submit work using a word processor. During this age, he had a dream of creating something, and started deconstructing everything to learn how many things are made. Larry also had an interest in instruments, which he played the flute and saxophone at school. When Larry got older, he wanted to pursue computer science, the world wide web to be exact, and started studying this topic. Once he graduated from high school, he started university, which is when the upcoming of google began.</p>

    <h3>Creation of Google/Contribution to Computer Science:</h3>
    <p>The creation of Google was Larry’s idea. As he was studying computer science in Stanford university, he had a vision of a web browser that would give people recommended links based on which ones have been used the most. Larry, alongside another student named Sergey Brin (who also deserves credit for Google’s creation) brought this idea into reality, and launched the web browser in 1996, only in Stanford’s network. The original name for this was “Backrub”, but changed a year later to “Google”, to represent the very huge number, googol. They wanted to represent googol because they want people to know that that’s the amount of information on the internet, which in my opinion is true.</p>

    <h3>What does Larry do now:</h3>
    <p class="text">Now, Larry has backed away from the position of CEO, but still presents speeches, and encourages people to study in the field of computer science.</p>
